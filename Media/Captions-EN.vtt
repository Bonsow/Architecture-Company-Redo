Every once in a while
I do something to challenge my creativity,

00:02.966 --> 00:05.400
and one of those things that I have done
every single year for,

00:05.400 --> 00:08.517
I think about the last four years,
maybe five years, I could be wrong.

00:08.850 --> 00:12.983
Was make a hoodie design for me
and any of my friends

00:12.983 --> 00:15.317
that wanted to as well,
usually before the ski season starts.

00:15.317 --> 00:17.517
Because guess what? I'm
going to wear hoodies when I'm skiing.

00:17.517 --> 00:19.167
Who would have thought is insane?

00:19.167 --> 00:22.467
This year I made the Levi Squad hoodie,
which is based off of the show

00:22.467 --> 00:24.984
Attack on Titan,
which is a phenomenal show

00:24.984 --> 00:28.851
with an amazing plot,
which I think everyone should watch.

00:28.851 --> 00:31.734
I know a lot of people don't want to
because oh my gosh, is anime.

00:31.734 --> 00:32.368
It's great.

00:32.368 --> 00:37.018
Okay, it's basically just it's
the least anime anime you ever seen.

00:37.218 --> 00:38.518
This is the front.

00:38.518 --> 00:39.901
This is the back. Very exciting.

00:39.901 --> 00:43.802
Last year I made a Black Ops two hoodie,
which kind of seems a little bit random.

00:43.802 --> 00:46.802
The game did come out in 2012,
but at the story

00:47.035 --> 00:50.152
takes place in 2025,
so of course I had to make it.

00:50.152 --> 00:52.669
It's one of my favorite games and
a lot of my other friends favorite game.

00:52.669 --> 00:55.919
So, you know, I'd be missing out
if I didn't make that for the 2025 footy

00:56.452 --> 00:58.802
the year before that. And in Minecraft,
I actually know the year before that.

00:58.802 --> 01:01.919
I did portal, which is an excellent
puzzle game released by valve,

01:01.919 --> 01:05.669
and then obviously Minecraft the year
before that, everyone has played Minecraft

01:05.669 --> 01:07.886
and if you haven't, you've either
solved a Rubik's Cube.

01:07.886 --> 01:08.686
I, I'm

01:08.686 --> 01:13.036
convinced that every year has either
solved a Rubik's Cube or played Minecraft.

01:13.036 --> 01:15.437
And if you haven't done
either of those things, you're

01:15.437 --> 01:19.920
kind of missing out on what it's like
to have the male experience in this world.

01:21.620 --> 01:23.604
Consider
giving me a pass on this assignment.
